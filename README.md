# Locality-Sensitive-Hashing-Implementation

In this project, we study Locality Sensitive Hashing with an application of finding plagiarized 
documents. We will use the steps – Shingling, Min-Hashing, and LSH to identify similar (plagiarized) documents. Used this project to analyze several 
algorithmic choices (for example, choosing ‘k’-shingles and ‘L’-hash functions, etc.).
